# COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on New Voter Registration

**Author:** Lillian Pulaski  

## Introduction
This project looks at how the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 affected new voter registration compared to 2016. The goal is to understand how crises impact voter participation and how registration rates can be maintained during difficult times.  

## Research Questions
1. How did swing states (AZ, CA, CO, FL, GA, NC, VA) compare to non-swing states (DE, DC, IL, MD, TX) in terms of new voter registrations between 2016 and 2020?  
2. Did California’s registration rates drop more or less than other states, given it has the largest population in the U.S.?  

## Data Limitations
- Only 12 states are included, not the full U.S.  
- Most states are southern, which may not represent national trends.  
- Data only covers January–May (some only January–April).  

## Key Findings
- California had the highest number of new registrations in Feb 2020: **238,281**.  
- Average monthly registrations across states: **~48,223**.  
- Top states with above-average months: **Texas (8), California (7), Florida (7)**.  
- Registrations rose early in 2020 but dropped sharply in March–April after COVID-19 began.  
- Swing states saw smaller drops compared to non-swing states.  

## Visualizations
- Total registrations by state (2016 vs 2020, Jan–Apr)  
- Registrations by month (2016 vs 2020)  
- Swing vs non-swing state averages (2016 vs 2020)
- Mapping of average registerations by state (2016-2020, Jan-Apr)

## Conclusion
- California and Texas had the highest registration counts, likely due to population size.  
- Non-swing states had higher averages but larger declines in 2020.  
- The pandemic clearly reduced new voter registrations, especially after March.  

## Future Work
- Include all 50 states for a full national picture.  
- Compare registrations relative to state populations.  
- Look at registration methods (online vs in-person).  
- Extend data past May 2020 for long-term effects.
